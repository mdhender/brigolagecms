	<h2>Bricolage 1.10.0 is in da House</h2>
		<div id="articlemeta">
            <p class="date">2006.01.23</p>
          </div>

          <p>It is with great pleasure that the Bricolage development team announces the
release of Bricolage 1.10. The culmination of over 19 months of development,
version 1.10 represents a significant advance for the celebrated open-source
content management and publishing system. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
          <h4>PHP Templating</h4>
          <p>Bricolage is the first content management system to support three different
Perl-based templating architectures (Mason, Template Toolkit, and
HTML::Template) as well as one in a completely different programming language:
PHP 5. Bricolage 1.10 adds PHP templating support, allowing template
developers to use the popular Web programming language to formatting their
documents for output. This functionality is thanks to a killer new technology,
known as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PHP-Interpreter"
title="PHP::Interpreter on CPAN"> PHP::Interpreter</a>, that loads the PHP 5
interpreter into a Perl 5 interpreter, and affords transparent access between
PHP and Perl code. The upshot is that PHP templaters get full access to the
entire Bricolage API, as well as the ability to use whatever other PHP or Perl
libraries they wish.</p>
          <p>Our expect is that this development will push Bricolage into new environments
where PHP developers can make use of the powerful content management and
publishing system without having to learn a new programming language.
Furthermore, we hope that PHP::Interpreter will act as a bridge between the
Perl and PHP communities, such that there is a greater exchange of ideas and a
greater ability to use each other's libraries.</p>
          <p>PHP::Interpreter was developed by OmniTI. PHP::Interpreter and the PHP
templating support in Bricolage were sponsored by SAPO--Portugal Online.</p>
          <h4>LDAP Authentication</h4>
          <p>Bricolage 1.10 includes support for a pluggable authentication architecture,
and in addition to its built-in authentication has added a module for
authentication against an LDAP directory server. This new feature is sure to
be welcome in busy enterprises that rely on a directory server, such as
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/directory/activedirectory/default.mspx" title="The Micrososft Windows Active Directory product page">Windows Active Directory</a>
<a href="http://www.novell.com/products/edirectory/" title="The Novel eDirectory product page">Novel eDirectory</a>, or 
<a href="http://www.openldap.org/" title="The OpenLDAP Open-Source directory
server home page">OpenLDAP</a>. Authentication can be limited to members of a
directory group, and supports LDAP v.3 and TLS connectivity. Contributed by
Kineticode.</p>
          <h4>Revamped Interface</h4>
          <p>Bricolage 1.10 sports a completely revamped browser interface that is XHTML
compliant and handles all styling via CSS. Yes, our 1999-era table-driven
interface is officially a thing of the past. The upshot is that the interface
is much more elegant, easier to skin with your own look (by overriding its CSS
files), allows search results and editing fields to expand and contract with
the browser window size, and delivers pages as much as 70% smaller than they
were before. The new interface was Contributed by Marshall Roch.</p>
          <p>A second major new UI feature is the revamped <q>Bulk Edit</q> interface. Gone is
the old <q>Super Bulk Edit</q> interface, with the Bulk Edit revisions overtaking
its functionality. Now you can edit the entire contents of a story document,
from the top-most element to the bottom-most field, in a single textarea field
with no reloads.</p>
          <p>The secret to allowing the full-text editing of Bricolage's unique
hierarchical element structures is Plain Old Documentation, or <q>POD</q>.
Subelements are denoted by a new <code>=begin</code> POD tag, and end with a matching
<code>=end tag</code>. The result is a much more natural editing interface.
Even related stories and media are supported by new POD tags. We believe that
this improvement will greatly facilitate the editing process, making Bricolage
a much more enjoyable product for content editors to work with.</p>
          <p>The Bulk Edit revision is complemented by two new additions: diff support and
a JavaScript-powered <q>Find and Replace</q> dialog box. Users can now see at a
glance the changes between one version of a document and another. The changes
are shown on a word-by-word basis, with additions in green with an underline
and deletions in red with a strikeout. A similar interface is used to show the
differences between versions of templates using the traditional <q>unified diff</q>
format rather than word-by word.</p>
          <p>The JavaScript-powered <q>Find and Replace</q> dialog box can be used to search by
strings or regular expressions in a Bulk Edit or Template editing environment.
Found bits of text can also be replaced or even globally replaced. We believe
that this powerful new feature, combined with the new Bulk Edit interface,
makes Bricolage a compelling content editing environment.</p>
          <p>The Bulk Edit, diff, and Find and Replace features were contributed by
Kineticode.</p>
          <h4>What's in a Name?</h4>
          <p>A somewhat less apparent but no less massive change in Bricolage 1.10 is a
system-wide naming normalization. Now all objects in Bricolage are known by
the same names, from the UI to the class to the database to the SOAP server.
Most noticeable in the UI will be the elimination of the old <q>Element Type</q>
object, and the renaming of <q>Element</q> objects to <q>Element Types.</q> This change
has the benefit of disambiguating element types, which define the structure of
documents, and elements, which are the document parts that contain content.
Gone is the confusion between element administration and content elements;
there are now only element types and elements.</p>
          <p>Another example is the renaming of <q>Data Elements</q> to <q>Field Types</q> and
<q>Fields</q>. And in tandem with this change, the storage of field values in the
database has been normalized, so that every field value does not also store
the name and key name of the field. This greatly reduces the size of the
database, and should make field lookups much faster, particularly in
formatting templates.</p>
          <p>And while we were going about normalizing field storage, the data types of
the database columns were also normalized. Old-style, inefficient column types
have been dumped in favor of more efficient, precise column types. For
example, all <q>NUMERIC</q> columns, which everywhere only contained integers
or booleans, have been converted the <q>INTEGER</q> and <q>BOOLEAN</q> data
types, as appropriate. This change will also be invisible to the everyday
Bricolage user, but should enhance database performance by optimizing the
storage of object attributes.</p>
          <p>And finally, a more visible change: Bricolage 1.10 introduces much more
flexible URI formats. You can now use many more parts of the cover date in the
URI, and in whatever format you like. So you could have a format of
<q>/%{categories}/%Y-%m-%d/</q> and end up with the URI <q>/foo/bar/2004-09-22/</q> if
you wanted. Or even <q>/%{categories}/%Y/%V/</q> to get the week number as part of
the URI. You can also include document UUIDs, and even your own text, (e.g.
foobar in <q>/%{categories}/%Y/%m/foobar/%{uuid}/</q>. This enhancement finally
allows users to almost always be able to replicate legacy URI formats in
Bricolage, for a seamless upgrade from an older CMS.</p>
          <h3>What are You Waiting For?</h3>
          <p>There are many, many more changes in Bricolage 1.10 that, overall, make using
it a joy. For a complete list of the changes, see
